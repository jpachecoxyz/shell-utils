* Overview
Welcome to the Shell Utilities repository! This project provides a collection of shell scripts tailored for different window managers and environments, including i3, Hyprland, and Sway, on X11 and Wayland.

* Repository Structure
The repository is organized into directories based on the environment and window manager:

#+begin_src shell
.
├── wayland
│   ├── hyprland
│   └── sway
└── x11
    └── i3
#+end_src

- wayland/hyprland :: Scripts for Hyprland on Wayland.
- wayland/sway :: Scripts for Sway on Wayland.
- x11/i3 :: Scripts for i3 on X11.

* Installation
To install the scripts, use the provided =install.sh= script. You can install scripts for a specific window manager or all at once. 

NOTE: The =install.sh= scripts use =$HOME/.local/bin= as the target, you can edit this variable inside the script, or copy the files manually somewhere as you have your path.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Install scripts for a specific window manager
./install.sh sway
./install.sh hyprland
./install.sh i3

# Install all scripts
./install.sh all
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Each script includes usage instructions in the comments at the top. You can run a script directly from the terminal or integrate it into your workflow.
